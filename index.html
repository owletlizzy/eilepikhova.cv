          <h2>Social Justice Educator Practices: Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="justified">I believe that as an instructor I must be a catalyst for students’ goal-attainment and, ultimately, academic success via engaging with what they have already accumulated in their lives. Hence, my main duty as an educator is not to show the only proper foundations of society, but, on the contrary, to foster their capacity for self-reflection, independent action and responsibility. Thus, the multitude of issues discussed, and a variety of perspectives considered  remain a constant focus of the classes I have the honor of teaching. </p>
          <p id="phil" class="justified">I strongly believe that science should be as diverse and as equitable as possible; a passion accessible by everyone whoever wants to get involved in it. In my opinion, it is crucial to put the heart on your sleeve to show what you stand for and where your biases may lie in the discussion of social issues. Openness and sincerity are those elements that truly foster a safer and a more genuine space for challenging discussions, allowing  to build a personable connection that transcends educational boundaries. Transparency of views, goals, requirements and evaluations follow the same pattern. Hence, all the courses that I teach are a communal creation, where I learn from students as much as they learn from me in a constant flow of information and energy exchanges.  All this produces maybe not a philosopher’s stone, but something equally magical.</p>
